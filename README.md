# Benjamini-Hochberg-procedure
The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure is a multiple testing correction method used to control the false discovery rate (FDR) in statistical hypothesis testing. It is commonly used in scientific research to address the problem of making multiple comparisons, which can increase the likelihood of finding false positives.

To implement the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure in your analysis, follow these steps:

Conduct your hypothesis testing for each comparison.

Rank the p-values from smallest to largest.

Calculate the critical value (q) using the formula: q = (i/m) * alpha, where i is the rank of the p-value, m is the total number of tests, and alpha is the desired FDR level.

Reject all null hypotheses with p-values less than or equal to the critical value (q).

Interpret the results of your analysis based on the corrected p-values.

It is important to note that the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure assumes that the null hypotheses are independent, and that the number of true null hypotheses is greater than or equal to the number of alternative hypotheses. If these assumptions are not met, alternative multiple testing correction methods may be more appropriate.

When reporting your results, it is recommended to include both the original p-values and the corrected p-values using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. This allows readers to assess the impact of multiple testing correction on the interpretation of your results.

Overall, the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure is a useful tool for controlling the false discovery rate in scientific research, and can help improve the accuracy and reliability of statistical hypothesis testing.
